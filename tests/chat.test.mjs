// tests/chat.test.mjs — start the chat server, talk to it, stop it.
//
// It needs Node.js and nothing else. Claude Code is never really run: the stand-in from
// helpers.mjs answers in the shape the real one answers in, which keeps the suite
// deterministic and lets it check the parts that are ours — the arguments the leader is run
// with, the thread being resumed, and what the transcript says when Claude Code is missing
// altogether.
//
// It reaches the server through tools/ow.mjs rather than bin/ow, because bin/ow refuses to run
// without Claude Code installed, which is the right behaviour for a person and the wrong one
// for this suite.
//
// Run it with: node --test tests/chat.test.mjs
